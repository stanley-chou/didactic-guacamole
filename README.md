We Gave the Repository a weird name because group memebers were having trouble working on the project when it was private and the public name made it impossible for people who wanted to cheat to randomly find our repository.

To Use Pull the Repository.

Run the Project_Main.m file to run the project through all the questions and play the voices at the end

Run the Demo.m file if all you want to hear are the voices.

the order is first the original voice, then the recreated voice, and then the recreated voice after being passed through a filter.
Noam Hirschorn speaks first, followed by Stanley Chou

.wav files are all sample voice clips used in the project
Not all the voice files used are in this repo, if you want more examples just ask.


Functions:
preEmphasis.m applies pre-emphasis to a sound signal
recreater.m and voiceslice.m recreate speech based on the input values for recreater.m
eucDistance.m calculates the average Euclidian distance of the vectors given to it.
cosDistance.m calculates the average cos similarity of the vectors given to it.

Thank you for taking the time to view our DSP Final Project! Group 15 wishes you a wonderful day.
